- Possible threading bug

The somewhat complicated threading that handles streaming process output text to the console
might be the source of a very occasional hang in operations that produce a lot of text, for
example the core git svn operations.  I've encountered this problem once, and another user
has as well, but I can't replicate it.

[followup: maybe fixed now?]


- Enabling/Disabling commands
I'm not understanding this model.

Currently I rely on isEnabled().  This works in general but not at startup.
Or rather, it works logically at startup  but in that context the the menu
and tool-bar widgets show as enabled when they're not. The widgets only show
the enabled state correctly once the user attempts to run one of the disabled
commands that look enabled. That of course fails, but from that point on the
widgets display correctly.
