- Possible threading bug

The somewhat complicated threading that handles streaming process output text to the console
might be the source of a very occasional hang in operations that produce a lot of text, for
example the core git svn operations.  I've encountered this problem once, and another user
has as well, but I can't replicate it.

[followup: maybe fixed now?]

 

- Actions are Deprecated

The extensions are all defined as 'action' elements in an 'actionSet', since that's what
the Eclipse plugin tutorial uses. Apparently the action/action-set API has been deprecated
but so far I haven't been able to find a usable description of how to port it to the new API.
