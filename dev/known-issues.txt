- Possible threading bug

The somewhat complicated threading that handles streaming process output text to the console
might be the source of a very occasional hang in operations that produce a lot of text, for
example the core git svn operations.  I've encountered this problem once, and another user
has as well, but I can't replicate it.

[followup: maybe fixed now?]
