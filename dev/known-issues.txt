- Possible threading bug

The somewhat complicated threading that handles streaming process output text to the console
might be the source of a very occasional hang in operations that produce a lot of text, for
example the core git svn operations.  I've encountered this problem once, and another user
has as well, but I can't replicate it.

[followup: maybe fixed now?]


- Enabling/Disabling commands
Currently I rely on isEnabled().  This works in general but not at startup.
Or rather, it works logically at startup  but in that context the the menu
and tool-bar widgets show as enabled when they're not. Once the user attempts
to run one of the disabled commands that look enabled, the command of course
fails and shows the dialog saying "The chosen operation is not enabled". From
from that point on the widgets show the enabled status correctly.

I can't figure out how to get the widgets to display properly from the start.
