- Possible threading bug

The somewhat complicated threading that handles streaming process output text to the console
might be the source of a very occasional hang in operations that produce a lot of text, for
example the core git svn operations.  I've encountered this problem once, and another user
has as well, but I can't replicate it.

Possibly there's a cleaner, built-in way to stream text?
 

- egit_ex.util.FileChooser.java display issue

The file-chooser dialog component I copied from the web doesn't behave quite right
at least in OS X. Specifically, the text component that shows the path of the selected
file does not resize itself unless the dialog as a whole is manually resized.  I don't
know enough SWT to see what the issue is here, The component description looks at least
plausible.


- Actions are Deprecated

The extensions are all defined as 'action' elements in an 'actionSet', since that's what
the Eclipse plugin tutorial uses. Apparently the action/action-set API has been deprecated
but so far I haven't been able to find a usable description of how to port it to the new API.
