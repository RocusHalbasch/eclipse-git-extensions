Currently there's no publicly accessible site for this plugin.  To use it you must build it yourself,
then add it as a local download site.  This is quite simple to do.

One-time-only setup:

1) You need the plugin development environment to build. The simplest way to do that is by installing the
   "Standard" packaging of Eclipse from http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/

2) Create a new workspace, add your clone of this repository to "Git Repositories" view, and import all projects.
   In Preferences/Java/Installed JREs, be sure to select a Java 7 JRE, not Java 6.

3) Copy file "site.xml" from the 'notes' project to the 'egit-extensions-update-site' project. See notes.txt
   for more on this


   
Building:

1) Open (double-click) the sites.xml file in egit-extensions-update-site
   This should display the Update Site Map view.  Click the "Build All" button.

That's it, you now have a local update site you can use.  After you pull updates of this repo
just build again.  Any references to this site in other workspaces will can be updated in the
usual way, via "Check for Updates".


Installing;
Once you have a local update site you'll want to install it in whatever workspaces you use for
your normal work.  Do this in the usual way: Help -> Install New Software and add a new site.
In this case use the "Local" option in the "Add Repository" dialog. In the file chooser, navigate
to egit-ex/update-site/ in your clone of this repository.  Then install in the usual way.

At the time of this writing you'll see a message saying: "There are no categorized items".
I don't know what's causing this, the site does have a categorized item. For now get around
this by unchecking the "Group items by category" check-box
